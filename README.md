# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to understand and predict customer churn in the telecom industry using Python. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify factors contributing to churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention.

Data Sources:
The analysis utilizes customer data, including:

Customer demographics: Age, gender, location
Account information: Subscription plans, contract types
Usage patterns: Call and data usage, service usage
Churn status: Whether the customer has churned or not
Key Metrics:

Churn Rate: Proportion of customers who have left
Churn Prediction: Likelihood of a customer churning
Feature Importance: Factors most influencing churn
Customer Segmentation: Identifying groups with higher churn rates
Analysis Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and patterns
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for model building
Model Building: Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict churn
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Insights:

Churn Drivers: Identifying key factors leading to customer churn
Retention Strategies: Developing targeted strategies to retain high-risk customers
Customer Profiles: Understanding characteristics of customers most likely to churn
Conclusion:
The analysis provides actionable insights into customer churn, enabling telecom companies to implement effective retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
